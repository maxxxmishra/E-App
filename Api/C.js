In manufacturing, the constraint is often referred to as a bottleneck.The Theory of Constraints takes a scientific approach to improvement. It hypothesizes that every complex system, including manufacturing processes, consists of multiple linked activities, one of which acts as a constraint upon the entire system (i.e., the constraint activity is the “weakest link in the chain”)."

It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name Python is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python."
